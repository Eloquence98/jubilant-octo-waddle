    question: `What is an NFT?`,
    answer: `A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique
                        digital asset that represents ownership of real-world items like art, video clips, music, and
                        more. NFTs use the same blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies. If you want to know
                        more about NFTs, check out our discord, message us, or there are some great Youtube videos`,
